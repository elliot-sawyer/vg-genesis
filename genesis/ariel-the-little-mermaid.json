    "Description": "Help either Ariel, the gleeful little mermaid, or Triton, her father, foil the evil Ursula, who has transformed everyone into small, green worm-like creatures, including the character you don't initially choose.\r\n\r\nRescuing requires you to simply swim into the unfortunate little victims as they hang about at fixed places in the watery world; while fending off and dodging enemies like eels, clams, sharks, and several other sea meanies. Friends like Flounder and Sebastian can also be summoned for a little helping hand.",
